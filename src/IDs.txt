Entity ID Description

	Every entity has an id of type unsigned. The id is used for identification
	purposes (obviously) in such actions as searches. Any valid unsigned integer
	may be dynamically assigned to an Entity except for the following:
		0 - Null Entity (undefined)
		1 - Default/Master Room (ENT_HOME)
		2 - The root-type user, God. Complete admin power. (ENT_GOD)
